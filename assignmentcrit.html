    <h1>Criticisms On The Great Animal Orchestra</h1>

<br/>
<br/>
Once entering the website, Bernie Krause speaks to the visitors with the statement to 'invite you
to listen to the symphony of natural world and rediscover the inherent beauty of it'. Not using the traditional chart that is common for us to show and indicate the data; The Great Animal Orchestra using a sonar-like compass to navigate where the user is visiting on the soundscape of the earth with a smaller map to identify the actual geographic locations. Once the user chooses the area one intends to explore, the landscape of actual photo transforms into simple lines and graphics that symbolize the institutions of the soundscape. Those patterns represent different quality of sound just as different department of the orchestra. Just like each soundscape symphony has different departments of orchestra, and each department has different players, it uses the scales of layers to lead the users to experience the voices that works on every departments and thus form the unique soundscape. The narrative of Bernie Kraus describe the time and locations of recording along the highlights on the sonar, using different motions, brightness, changes of scales on the graphics of the players. Users are allowed to move the mouse onto those graphics and the center of the sonar navigator will identify which player it is.

Take the Acoustic Niches catalog for example; It samples the rich soundscape of Gonarezhou, Zimbabwe and once you click on it, the narrative of Bernie Krause will give you an overall introduction of this sound symphony and leave you to explore it.  The thin and rotated rectangles represents the insects, triangles for the birds, the circles with different holes in the middles are animals and the curves are the wind blowing. Whenever you hear those different department vocals its music, those graphic moves and vibrates according to the music it plays. The central part of the navigation also shows the animals which those graphic symbolizes.
To get more detailed information of the sonic department instead of showing the abstract representation, another section unfolds with the species, locations and other information such as date, season,location. GPS coordinates, altitude, biome, habitat and climate to give the users an overlook of this soundscape all in a consistent graphic style.

The background colors of the webpage of sonar navigator also give sense of the natural surroundings while recording. The sound of Alogonguin Park in Ontario, Canada was recording at daybreak so the background is a radiant from orange to green, and the green also depicts the natural landscape of the national park while the Pacific Rim with a grayish blue hints the ocean environments and Lincoln Meadow with grass green to suggest the mountain scenery.With the intention to lead users into the world of animal orchestra just as its title and statement, this project works very successfully to construct the graphics, animation and of course the sounds together to form a sense .
