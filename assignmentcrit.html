    <h1>Criticisms On The Great Animal Orchestra</h1>

<br/>
<br/>
The Great Animal Orchestra
Bernie Krause, bioacoustician and musician, have been working on recording sounds in nature and collecting data for more than 50 years. The massive wild soundscape he has accumulated covers from sea shores to mountains, including the sounds creating by natural forces, such as water and wind, animals, or the interactions between. The data visualization project is done by London-based collective United Visual Artists, using it as a tool to represent Krause’s work in a way that is not only sonic but also combining with infographics, maps and interactions to catalogue and portray this soundscape into a story that not only conveys narrative but also the experiences.
<br/>
<br/>
Once entering the website, Bernie Krause speaks to the visitors with the statement to ‘invite you
to listen to the symphony of natural world and rediscover the inherent beauty of it’ . Not using the common and  traditional charts  to show and indicate the data; The Great Animal Orchestra using a sonar-like compass to navigate where the user is visiting on the soundscape of the earth with a smaller map to identify the actual geographic locations. Once the user chooses the area one intends to explore, the landscape of actual photo transforms into simple lines and graphics that symbolize the institutions of the soundscape. Those patterns represent different quality of sound just as different departments of the orchestra.
<br/>
<br/>

The project is built as its concept, symphony orchestra.  Each soundscape symphony has different departments of orchestra, and each department has different players. It plays with the u the scales of layers to lead the users to experience the voices that play in every departments and thus form unique soundscapes. Bernie Kraus speaks to you to describe the time and locations of recording along the  graphic highlights on the sonar navigator, using different motions, brightness, changes of scales on the graphics of the players. Users are allowed to move the mouse onto those graphics and the center of the sonar navigator will identify which player it is.
<br/>
<br/>

Take the ‘Acoustic Niches’ catalog for example; It samples the rich soundscape of Gonarezhou, Zimbabwe and once you click on it, Bernie Krause will give you an overall introduction of this sound symphony and leave you to explore it.  The thin and rotated rectangles represents the insects, triangles for the birds, the circles with different holes in the middles are animals and the curves are the wind blowing. Whenever you hear those different department vocals its music, those graphic moves and vibrates according to the music it plays. The central part of the navigation also shows the animals which those graphic symbolizes.To get more detailed information of the sonic department instead of showing the abstract representation, another section unfolds with the species: locations and other information such as date, season,location, GPS coordinates, altitude, biome, habitat and climate to give the users an overlook of this soundscape all in a consistent graphic style.
<br/>
<br/>
The background colors of the webpage of sonar navigator also give sense of the natural surroundings while recording. Instead of using real photos or videos to recreate the scene, the project goes with an artistic and abstract portrayal. For example, the sound of Alogonguin Park in Ontario, Canada was recording at daybreak; so the background is a radiant from orange to green. Orange is for color of sun and the green depicts the natural landscape of the national park. As for the recording of the Pacific Rim, the background color is  grayish blue, for it  hint the ocean environments. Another example such as Lincoln Meadow with grass green to suggest the mountain scenery. With the intention to lead users into the world of animal orchestra, the designing of the website recreates the world in a conceptual way and leave us to imagine the world not only by hearing but also seeing.  Just as its title and statement, this project works very successfully to construct the graphics, animation and of course the sounds together to form a sense.

<br/>
The Great Animal Orchestra aim at create an interactive experience that allows the users to revisit and similar the sonic landscape that Bernie Krause has been working on and collected. The concept of ‘ animal orchestra’ is well executed on the aspect of designing the interactive surface and the representation of graphic. It is easy to understand, straightforward yet also carries the poetic character as the creator wants the users to explore the sonic world that is far away from human civilization. The sound, which is the main data for that constructed the website, is for sure beautiful and picturesque; the visualization is also idyllic. However, the limitations of choosing the more simple way to reflect the purity of the world of sound might also lose the opportunity to visualize it with more abundant and detailed presentation. The narrative experience is no doubt strong and alluring, but there might be chances to depict it with a more informative and precise way rather than simple graphics, animations and texts so the users not only experience the sonic world but also have a deeper understanding of how the orchestra is played. For example to draw different flowing frequencies of the sound origins not only to indicate the music is playing like staff notation but also shows more information about the data itself. It might also be the limitation of the data itself for it is not numeric but sonic and it requires more work and analysis to present it in a way that is more in depth.  However, to reconstruct a sonic data into a visual narrative, this project surly successfully tell its story with focus and simplicity while strongly tie the experience with the concept.
